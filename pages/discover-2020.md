<b>Build Them Up! Teach Children Digital Literacy Through Play</b><br>
<b>4.00pm to 5.00pm, Saturday, 28 November 2020</b><br>
The use of technology by children has proliferated through the exponential growth in availability of apps, digital channels and platforms. This ease of connectivity and necessity to be online by children also presents a new set of issues for parents, such as difficulty in engaging their children on digital literacy topics due to its potential abstract nature.

Listen to Mr Dieter Carstensen, Head of Digital Safety at the LEGO Group, who will share his insights on the importance of parent-children engagement, practical tips, and activities for parents and educators to engage children on digital literacy and safety topics through play-based techniques. He will be joined by Media Literacy Council member Prof Lim Sun Sun, Professor of Communication and Technology at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, who will be providing insights to how technology has changed parent’s and children’s digital literacy habits, and the importance of understanding online risks and how to navigate them in a safe manner. <b>Registration is now closed</b><br>

*Both webinars are conducted on zoom and require pre-registration.*<br>
